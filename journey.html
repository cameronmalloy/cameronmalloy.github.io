	      I wasn’t the greatest student. I wasn’t very good at studying. I ended up playing video games instead of studying. I never did homework. I never went to office hours. My high school years were a compilation of me not really trying very hard and my grades reflected that.
	      <br><br>
		    I applied to 13 different colleges and got into my 2 least favorite ones. All the while my classmates were getting accepted into institutions like Stanford, Brown, and Dartmouth. I felt like I wasn’t able to live up to the expectations set by my community and family.

	       I had a feeling if I applied myself in school more I could actually see the results I was looking for. I decided to go to community college for multiple reasons. For one, I didn’t think I was ready to be away from home. I didn’t know how to cook, do laundry, and really live life and be responsible for my own well-being. Secondly, you go to community college to help transfer to the best 4-year institution possible and you go to a university to get a bachelor’s degree. Community college, in my eyes, seemed like a second chance.
         	<br><br>
         	There were a lot of reasons pushing me away from Community College as well though. For instance, the term “Transfer Maze” comes to mind. It’s the fact that most transfers don’t actually transfer after 2 years at community college, more likely after 4 or 6 years

         	.But, the rewards outweighed the risks. To me, staying a couple of extra years for another chance to redeem myself would be worth it. I saw this as another opportunity to live up to expectations

        	A lot of people ask me how I did so much better in college (both 2-year and 4-year institutions) than in high school. The most obvious reason, in my opinion, can be seen through my typical everyday schedule between high school and community college.

        	I set my goal to get into a good 4-year university, and to do that I had to focus on grades. That meant I had to cut down on video games. I focused more on school and working, whether it be as a barista or on side coding projects. I tried to put myself in more situations that led me to some sort of learning experience, like working at Starbucks to learn what retail is like, tutoring to learn how to teach, or honors classes to learn how to do research. I made more time for these types of activities to help me grow as an intellectual and as a learner.

        	<br>
        	I remember visiting UC San Diego. I remember when they were talking about transferring there, that they primarily look at grades for transfer acceptances, and not well-roundedness as much. So, my first semester in community college I focused on my grades and working at Starbucks. I started volunteering at Reading Partners and giving back to my community in my second semester. My third semester I began the math club at my college. And my last semester I became a tutor for almost every STEM class. My experience at community college quickly grew to being more about grades. I sought out each semester to be better than the semester before. I wanted to do more for others and for myself.
        	<br><br>
        	I sought to get better every semester because that’s also what top-tier colleges look for in students. Most of the time they want to see an upward trend in your grades, but I thought why stop there? The best colleges in the nation look for well-rounded students, and an upward trend in community involvement and teaching shows exactly that.
        	<br><br>
        	I made drastic changes from when I was in high school to when I was in community college. As a result, I got into all the UC’s as a transfer when I was denied as a freshman. I learned that community college is really about learning what kind of person you want to be. It’s about building work ethic and time management. It’s about community (hence the name), being a part of a community, and leading that community.
