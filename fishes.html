        The acceptance process for transfer students is a little different than the process for freshman students. Most freshman are undeclared and if they are declared, it’s not uncommon that they change majors within the first or second year. Transfer students on the other hand, already have two years of college under their belt. So, colleges expect transfers to know their major. Universities are looking for students who are ready to dive into upper division level classes, which for most majors, differ greatly from lower division classes. The key to a competitive transfer application is to show that you are ready for those higher-level classes. 
        <br><br>
        This whole post is littered with my own personal experiences. These are highlighted in italics and are meant to give you a view of how I went about things during my application process. They are by no means meant for you to follow.
        <br><br>
        I also use some acronyms in this post. Be sure to check out the FAQ page to learn more about them.
        <br><br>
        So, without further-ado, the most important things colleges look for in a good transfer students, separated by category:

        It’s not shocking that the number one thing a 4-year looks for in a student is their grades. One of the great things about community colleges is that they teach essentially the same material as the corresponding courses to a 4-year. Take a look at assist.org to find out what those corresponding courses are. However, the rigor of the courses at a 4-year is much harder than that at a 2-year. For that reason, it’s very important to do well in community college courses. 
        <br><br>
        <div id="strongy">CSU's, UCSB, UCSD, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside, and UC Merced</div>
        If you are applying to one of the above schools, then pay attention to this part of the post. These schools almost primarily look at grades for the admittance of transfer students. This contrasts the well-roundedness they look for in incoming freshman. As a prospective transfer student, they just look at how good your grades are. They want to admit people who are ready to take on the challenge of the universities’ programs, and the best measurement of that is through your grades. It doesn’t necessarily mean a high GPA though. Colleges and universities take into account the rigor of courses, relevancy of classes to your intended major, and trends in your grades when determining admission.
        <br><br>
        Colleges pay attention to how hard the classes are. They compare your grade to other applicants from the same college. If everyone got an A and you got a C, the college will question what went wrong, but if you got a B+ and everyone else got a B, then they’ll treat that grade like it was an A. They will also look at your rigor of schedule. Colleges will expect a higher GPA from a student with a 12 unit course load and no extracurricular activities compared to a 16 unit single mom. College also take into account honors classes, which are typically harder and require more original thinking. Honors classes show your work ethic and dedication to a certain subject. It also shows that you are willing to do the extra work that is seen a lot in upper-division courses.
        <br><br>
        Trends are also a very important aspect when admissions officers are looking at grades. An upward trend in grades looks better than a declining trend in grades. They want to see that the prospective student is coming into their school strong and prepared. An upward trend also means your growing and learning from your mistakes. A constant trend is only really good if it’s a constant stream of all A’s. If it’s a constant trend of all B’s, then that means there’s room for improvement and you’re not finding out how to improve.
        <br><br>
        <i>I started my first semester in community college with a C in English. I got an A in another English class my next semester. This showed that I learned from my mistakes my first semester and became a stronger student. Even though my GPA is worse than if I got an A both semesters, arguably I’ve become a better student.</i>
        <br><br>
        Make sure not to push yourself though. If you can’t do 16 units, then cut down. If you don’t think you can take any honors classes, then don’t. The most important part is to learn from your classes and do the best to your ability. Pushing yourself will only end in a worse GPA. A person who got a C in an honors class looks worse than another student who got an A in the same class that was not in honors.

        <div id="strongy">UC Berkeley, UCLA, and Private Schools</div>
        If you want to transfer to one of the above colleges, then read this section as well as the one above. Most of what was mentioned in the previous section for the CSU’s, other UC’s, and out of state public schools don’t change here. The main difference between the two sections is that these schools look more at well-roundedness. Grades are not the only thing they look at. There are plenty of examples of students with high GPA’s getting denied by UC Berkeley and UCLA. These schools are known to be more competitive, and look at all aspects of the application. Personal statements and extracurricular activities are weighted heavily in the admission process. Don’t get me wrong though, grades are still the most important thing, but for these schools, applications must be more well-rounded.

        <div id="strongy">CSU's, UCSB, UCSD, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside, and UC Merced</div>
        I unfortunately don’t know enough about how CSU’s and public out of state schools take extracurricular activities into account. I can only guess that it’s pretty similar to how UC’s and private schools view extracurricular activities.
        <br><br>
        <div id="strongy">UC Berkeley and UCLA</div>
        These schools look very closely at your extracurricular activities. Admissions officers use these to learn more about what kind of person you are and if you would be a good fit at their university.
        <br><br>
        <i>During my orientation at UC Berkeley, I heard many admissions officers say that Berkeley is hard and that we were all chosen for a reason. They warned us that classes are probably much harder, but many of us were chosen because of the time management we displayed in community college. What they were saying is that we didn’t only get good enough grades, we also showed we could get those grades while also having a lot of other commitments in our life. That time management skill was a leading factor for acceptances.</i>
        <br><br>
        However, not all extracurriculars are created equal. For instance, high school sports will be pushed aside and probably not even looked at, but admissions officers would look closer at part time work. Jobs and volunteering your time are very good extracurriculars, especially if they relate to your intended major. You want activities and jobs that you have a passion for and where you can write about your successes, failures, what you learned from them, and how you grew. These activities show your passion for the subject your studying, commitment to your community, and/or leadership skills. Universities want to know that you have learned skills outside of the classroom.
        <br><br>
        Most applications ask you to list your extracurriculars. However, colleges want you to talk about them in more detail in your personal statements. They want to know how these activities helped you grow as a student, person, and learner. Extracurriculars is a great talking point for personal statements.
        <br><br>
        <div id="strongy">Private Schools</div>
        Private schools will want to see a little more from its applicants. It’s not surprising if a private school asks for a resume or research experience (Columbia University for instance is known for asking for these and having certain personal statements about working experience). Most of the time those items aren’t required, but if they’re on the application, it’s better to have them ready. The purpose of these is because these universities want more experienced students with exposure to their major outside of school. The key is to know what kind of things they’re looking for. Maybe one college wants outside work with your field of study and another wants research experience. Research what the schools want ahead of time so you can get a job or research position for the application.

          Essays are arguably more important than extracurricular activities, but this section builds upon those activities. Your outside of school work may not seem like the best and most related work, but it’s what you got out of that work that’s more important to the university, not the work itself.
          <br><br>
          <div id="strongy">CSU's</div>
          CSU’s don’t require essays.
          <br><br>
          <div id="strongy">UCSB, UCSD, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside, and UC Merced</div>
          All UC applications require a few essays to be written. For the colleges above, they mostly disregard the essays when accepting applicants. The essays are instead sent off to be looked at for scholarships, so don’t slack off on these. More information and tips on essays below.
          <br><br>
          <div id="strongy">UC Berkeley, UCLA, and Private Schools</div>
          These schools highly value your personal statements. It gives insight into what kind of a person you are and if you are the right fit to succeed. This is also a chance for them to determine if you are ready for their upper division classes. They are also looking for students that can succeed in their university. Overall, your essays are going to be a mixture of bland and creative. 
          <br><br>
          Let’s start with the blander essays. There’s always going to be an essay along the lines of “Discuss everything you’ve done since high school to prepare you for a 4-year college”. Your response should be something like an essay form of a CV of the past years in community college. You should tie in how you’re prepared for upper division classes, and provide evidence to convince them that you are.
          <br><br>
          <i>Lower division math courses are mainly computation whereas upper division math class are very proof based and a lot of writing. So, I emphasized the fact my honors classes and outside work has led to a great deal of exposure to mathematical proofs.</i>
          <br><br>
          A good strategy is to do some research about what upper division courses are like in your intended major, then tailoring your essays to show you are ready for those types of courses.
          <br><br>
          There will be creative responses too. This is a chance to show your personality. Make your essays pop and grab the reader’s attention. Don’t forget you can interpret essays in different ways. Many prompts are much broader and allow for different ways to approach it.
          <br><br>
          <i>One of my essays asked about how I contributed to my community. Most people talked about contributing to their neighborhood community and volunteering, but I took a different approach and talked about the community at my job at Starbucks.</i>
          <br><br>
          There will also be prompts where you can (and most probably should) talk about your extracurriculars. Universities want you to expand on your outside work. Don’t be bland about this though. Try to show how you learned something, or gained a skill of value. Also, don’t forget to relate the theme of your essay to your major and succeeding in 4-year institutions.
          <br><br>
          <i>A prompt I had was to talk about a certain talent or skill I had. I said I pretty much said I was amazing at chess. I could have said that I beat everyone that came in my way and that I was unstoppable. Instead I said that I was able to see a couple of moves ahead, know the best moves by analyzing the board, predicting their moves, and noticing pressure points and weak spots in the construction of their defense. Then I went on to relate this to algorithms, analysis, and critical thinking, which is all necessary for proof-based math courses. This may not be an example of using an extracurricular, but I think this is a good example of using creativity and relating skills to your major.</i>
          <br><br>
          Don’t forget to answer the prompt. It’s the last thing I’m writing in this section because probably every English teacher has given this advice, but it’s also the most important.

          These schools don’t require letters of recommendation.
          <br>
          <div id="strongy">Private Schools</div>
          You’ve probably heard all the advice for gathering letters of recommendation if you’ve been looking into private schools. I might as well talk about them though since they’re still a very important aspect of private school transfer applications.
          <br><br>
          <i>I was at a mathematics panel headed by faculty that led research internships. One of the faculty said that when looking at applications, “We don’t trust what someone says about themselves. We only trust what others can say about them”.</i>
          <br><br>
          Letters of recommendation can make or break an application. Choose a professor that will write a genuine and positive letter. Get to know the professor too. The more personal the letter (in a good way), the better the letter is.
